Represents the services available for booking.

Place within the System:
    The Service entity is a core component of the hairdressing booking system. It defines the various services
    that customers can book, providing essential details such as the name, description, duration, and price of each
    service. This information is crucial for both customers and service providers to ensure that the right services are
    offered and booked accurately.

    Services will be displayed to users in the booking interface, allowing them to select from the available options and
    schedule appointments accordingly. The detailed descriptions and durations will help customers make informed decisions
    about the services they need. Additionally, the service information will be used by administrators and staff to manage
    and update the service offerings, ensuring that the business can adapt to new trends and customer demands.

    By maintaining a comprehensive list of services, the system will be able to provide accurate booking and scheduling functionality,
    optimize resource allocation, and enhance the overall user experience by offering a clear and organized catalog of
    services.
