Place within the System:
    The Appointment entity is a core component of the hairdressing booking system. It facilitates the scheduling
    and management of appointments for both customers and service providers. Each appointment record provides critical
    information about the service being booked, the user who booked it, and the scheduled time and duration. This
    information is essential for coordinating service delivery, managing staff schedules, and ensuring that resources
    are used efficiently.

    By maintaining detailed records of each appointment, the system will be able provide timely reminders and updates to users,
    track the status of services, and generate reports on service utilization and user engagement. The Appointment model
    will play a key role in the user experience, enabling customers to view and manage their bookings through the
    frontend interface. It will integrate with other system components, such as notifications and payments, to provide a
    seamless and comprehensive booking experience.
